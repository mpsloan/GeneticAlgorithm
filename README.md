# GeneticAlgorithm
This program reads in a number of items (item class) from a .txt file and stores them as an ArrayList with other 
items. Each of these ArrayLists is called a chromosome (chromosome class). The program performs numerous methods 
in order to breed the most effective chromosome that can carry the greatest value of items while not exceeding 10 lbs.
This program does this throughout many generations and once it is determined the most fit chromosome will be displayed
to the console. This program works with items.txt as well as more_items.txt, but the population size, as well as the 
generation size must be tweaked in order to eventually return the most desired chromosome.
